# Syntecxhub_Project_TCP_Port_Scanner
A multithreaded TCP port scanner built in Python as part of the Syntecxhub internship program. Supports single port and port range scanning with logging and exception handling.

# TCP Port Scanner  Syntecxhub Internship Project

# Description
This project is a multithreaded TCP port scanner developed in Python as part of the Syntecxhub internship program.  
It allows scanning a single host for open, closed, or timeout TCP ports within a specified range.

# Objectives
- Learn socket programming in Python
- Understand TCP connections
- Implement multithreading for faster scanning
- Handle network exceptions properly
- Log scan results to a file

# Features
- Scan a single port or a range of ports
- Multithreaded scanning
- Detect open, closed, and timeout ports
- Log results to a file
- Command-line interface

# Technologies Used
- Python 3
- socket
- threading
- argparse
- logging
